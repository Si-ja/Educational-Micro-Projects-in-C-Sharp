# Educational Micro Projects in C#

## Idea

This repository holds small projects that I have done in a span of say 1-2 hours, by mostly also learning about them first. The main idea behind these projects is to do them in C# and make sure they are not based on complicated implementations, but actually be the complete opposite. These projects are meant to show relatively simple implementations of certain capabilities that C# is available of, but which might not often be utilized. Think of this repo as a set of simple educational components that show various things you might or might not use with C#, but are definitely good to know. And as a side note: I'm still learning most of these things myself and trying them out.

## Current Projects
